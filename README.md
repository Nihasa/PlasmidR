# PlasmidR
An R Package to Generate and Analyze Plasmid Maps.


R is becoming increasingly used in bioinformatics; packages such as SeqinR allow for simple retrieval and analysis of DNA 
and protein sequences, but one major functionality is lacking: the ability to simply and efficiently generate DNA diagrams.

The goal of this package will be primarily to take as input a character vector of dna nucleotides (5' -> 3'), generate range
annotations and plot linear cassettes or circular plasmids with the flexibility and publication quality that R user are
accustomed to.
